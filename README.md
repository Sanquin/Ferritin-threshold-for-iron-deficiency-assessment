# Ferritin threshold assessment code
Here you can find the R-code referenced in the paper "Change in hemoglobin to identify a functionally relevant ferritin threshold for iron deficiency: A study in blood donor populations".

The analysis code can be used using R in the command line, see the folder [CommandLine](https://github.com/Sanquin/Ferritin-threshold-for-iron-deficiency-assessment/tree/main/CommandLine). The analysis can also be conducted in using RStudio and Quarto, see the folder [Quarto](https://github.com/Sanquin/Ferritin-threshold-for-iron-deficiency-assessment/tree/main/Quarto).
